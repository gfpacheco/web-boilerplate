# Web Boilerplate

> This project is just an experiment.

I made it to actually learn about the tools everybody is talking about.

Step by step I:

- Created a basic [React][react] app
- Enable JSX and ES6 syntax by using [Babel][babel]
- Added an [Node][node]+[Express][express] server
- Started using [Webpack][webpack] build tool
- Changed server syntax to use [some of the ES6][node-es6] features
- Added the [Redux][redux] flow
- Added [React Router][react-router] for navigation control
